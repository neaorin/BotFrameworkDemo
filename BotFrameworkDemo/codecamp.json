For example, Java 8 recently introduced new features (lambda expressions and method references) and APIs (Streams, Optional and CompletableFutures) inspired from functional ideas such as first-class functions, composition and immutability. However, what does this mean for my existing codebase?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we show how you can refactor your traditional object-oriented Java to using FP features and APIs from Java 8 in a beneficial manner. We will discuss things like:\r\n\r\nHow to adapt to requirement changes using first-class functions.\r\nHow you can enhance code reusability using currying.\r\nHow you can make your code more robust by favouring immutability over mutability.\r\nHow you can reduce null pointer exceptions with Optional.",

You'll need to learn to introspect your design, to make it express your thoughts in code. It may take years of practice to reach that point, but the path starts with some basic guidelines and 'code smells' that you ought to know, along with a core toolset of refactoring techniques.\r\nAs simple as some of these might seem, they will become the starting point of a lot of discussions about core principles of good software design, such as DRY, SRP, DIP, and KISS. Come and enjoy an entertaining, tangible presentation of key concepts in Clean Code, that will allow you to easily coach others, back at work.\r\nLooking forward to share my passion with you: writing expressive code that is a pleasure to work with.\r\nPS: In the end, let's talk a bit about writing clean code using Java8 lambdas/Streams, shall we? :)",

On the demo side you will be able to discover 2 very powerful tools to help you automate your cloud infrastructure: Terraform and Ansible. Terraform does a great job at infrastructure provisioning the artifacts that are more statical: like VPCs, security groups, load balancers, DNS entries, queues. With it you can easily codify your infrastructure and keep it in source control. While Ansible makes the connection between all the existing cloud infrastructure and provisioning of your virtual machines: starting them, finding them dynamically, installing your apps, monitoring of the vm and apps, releasing the vms, all the stuff needed for immutable deploys.\r\n",

The GC left more than a few production systems burning in smoke after developers failed to anticipate the effects of real production loads on the memory subsystem. In this talk, we will methodically measure and improve the .NET garbage collector’s performance. We will begin with a quick refresher on dynamic performance tools that can identify GC issues: CLR performance counters, ETW GC events, and ETW object allocation events; as well as static analysis tools, such as the Roslyn-based heap allocations analyzer. Then, we will inspect multiple issues at the source code level: excessive boxing, unintended effects of lambdas closing over local variables, await-generated state machines, intermediate objects in LINQ queries, and many others. We will also discuss higher-level memory problems: how to get rid of large object allocations, how to avoid finalization, and how to convert heap-based designs to local objects. Some of these ideas are now being applied at the language and framework level in C# 7 and .NET Core. At the end of the talk, you will be equipped to reduce memory traffic and GC overhead in your own applications, often by a factor of 10 or more!",
